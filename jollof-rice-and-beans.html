<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While lots of Nigerians make either porridge bean or jollof rice as a meal, there is a way to combine both into a sumptuous meal as well.</p>
<p>What we have above is a delicious-looking and tasting plate of rice and beans combo that is made using my this recipe. You might wanna try this next time instead of just jollof rice.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups of rice.</li><li>2 cups of beans.</li>
    <li>4 Fresh tomatoes.</li><li>3 Tablespoons of canned tomato paste.</li>
    <li>3 seasoning cubes.</li><li>1 cup of sliced onions.</li>
    <li>1 KG Chicken.</li><li>1 teaspoon of powdered ginger.</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of powdered garlic.</li><li>500ml Vegetable oil.</li>
    <li>5 scotch bonnet (peppers).</li><li>Salt to taste.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Start by parboiling the rice and beans separately, wash the both of them, and set aside in different bowls.So how do you precook rice? <p>Just pour 3 cups of rice into boiling water, let it boil for 2 minutes, wash and set aside.Do the same for the beans.</p></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Blend the tomatoes and scotch bonnet peppers together to make a paste.
        <p>Parboil the chicken with all the ingredients (2 seasoning cubes, half cup of sliced onions, salt). Let the chicken boil for 10-15 minutes.
        Pick with a kitchen fork and set aside.</p>
        <p>Please be sure to reserve the chicken stock as it will be used later</p></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Fry the Chicken and set aside.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Transfer the parboiled beans into a cooking pot and boil with just water and sliced onions for 30-40 minutes, this depends on the kind of beans you are cooking, if you are using Blackeye beans just 30 min would be enough but if it is the brown beans it would take about 40 minutes before it is 60% cooked.</p> <p>You just want it almost done.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Set your cooking pot on heat, and add oil 250ml (Use the same oil that you fried the chicken with).</p>
        <p>Add half a cup of sliced onions, fry for a minute, and add the ground tomatoes and pepper that was made earlier. Also, add the 3 tablespoons of tomato paste.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Stir and fry until it looses its sour taste and thickens, remember to turn frequently to avoid burning, should take 15-20 minutes.<br> Once the tomato is fried remove half and set it aside.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add the chicken stock. Add two cups of water, 1 seasoning cube, salt to taste, a teaspoon each of curry, ginger, and garlic powder. Stir and let it boil.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Taste for salt, then add the precooked bean and parboiled rice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Stir together and add the remaining fried tomato/pepper that you previously set aside. Spread evenly on top of the cooking rice and beans.
        Add the remaining sliced onions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Cover and cook on medium heat for the next 30 to 40 minutes. Check when the rice/beans are soft.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Make sure everything is cooked properly and serve with the chicken.</p>
    </li>
