<h2><em>What temperature to bake bread to?</em></h2>

<h2><em>Can I Make Dough By Hand?</em></h2>
    <p>Yes. If you don't own an electric stand mixer this white bread can also be done the old fashioned way;just by using a mixing bowl and a wooden spoon. Mix in as much flour as you can with the spoon then as it starts to get heavy, knead in the remaining flour by hand.</p>
